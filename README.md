# Heart disease prediction
Application of various Machine learning algorithms to predict the chances of heart disease.

# Implementation
[Usage of multiple machine learning algorithms](https://github.com/bibek-huma/Gradient-descent-with-L1-regularization/blob/master/Heart%20disease%20prediction.ipynb)

# Dataset
[Dataset used](https://github.com/bibek-huma/Gradient-descent-with-L1-regularization/blob/master/heart_disease_prediction.csv)

# If prediction equals true then manual command to get the adjustment in excercise routine, and consultation on dietary changes is invoked. Including alert notice for suspicious and mallicious actions or intent of foreign agents to avoid sudden hospitalization and hospital readmission.
