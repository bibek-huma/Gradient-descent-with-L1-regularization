# Heart disease prediction
Application and application of various Machine learning algorithms to predict the chances of heart disease.

# Implementation
[Usage of multiple machine learning algorithms](https://github.com/bibek-huma/Gradient-descent-with-L1-regularization/blob/master/Heart%20disease%20prediction.ipynb)

# Dataset
[Dataset used](https://github.com/bibek-huma/Gradient-descent-with-L1-regularization/blob/master/heart_disease_prediction.csv)

# If prediction equals true then invoke the manual command to get the adjustment in excercise routine, and consultation on dietary changes
